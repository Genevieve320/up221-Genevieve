# Profile
My name is Genevieve Chacon. I am a first year in the Urban and Regional Planning Master's program at UCLA. My concentration is Transportation Planning because I believe that every deserves access to clean, multi-modal forms of transportation. I was born and raised in LA and I studied Public Policy with an emphasis in Environmental Policy at UC Riverside (Go Highlanders!). I'm trying to get back into my hobbies this year like reading, drawing, and playing the piano. I've also been wanting to get out of my shell more so if you see me on campus please say hi! :)

Here is a photo of my cat Angel!

# Course Despcription
UP 221 is an introduction to spatial data science. The objective of the course is to "critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research".

# Project Ideas and Objectives
In this course, I want to learn how to be comfortable with software like Python in order to work with transportation and climate change related spatial data science. A possible project idea is to analyze bus routes and plan more efficient bus lanes in Los Angeles.
