# up221-Genevieve
My name is Genevieve Chacon. I am a first year in the Urban and Regional Planning Master's program at UCLA. My concentration is Transportation Planning because I believe that every deserves access to clean, multi-modal forms of transportation.
UP 221 is an introduction to spatial data science. In this course, I want to learn how to be comfortable with software like Python in order to work with transportation and climate change related spatial data science.
